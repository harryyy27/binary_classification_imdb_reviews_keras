# Binary Clssification Of IMDB Reviews Keras

Basic neural network used to classify imdb reviews as either positive or negative reviews. Correctly classifies Parasite review as positive (how could it not thought right?)

This uses a classic multilayer perceptron to accept one hot encoded sequences of words to classify a set of movie reviews after training. As an example of its efficacy I personally downloaded and encoded a review to be passed into the network and it worked wonders :D. A have completed a much improved version of this project later on Kaggle
